    <h2>It's time to make some granola!</h2>

    <p>
      We're doing the Girls Who Code #codingathome Week2 project, building a
      tutorial website, and it's made with
      <a href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a>!
    </p>

    <p>
      So let's make some granola! This is a great project for at-home schooling
      for kids of all ages, because you get to practive with math (measurements
      and proportions), you build reading skills (by following directions), and
      you make something healthy and tasty to share with the whole family.

    <h3>
      Here's what you need:
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 cups oatmeal</li>
      <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup honey</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1.5 cups unsalted sunflower seeds, toasted</li>
      <li>2/3 cup sesame seeds, toasted</li>
      <li>1 cup sliced almonds, toasted</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Here are the steps:
    </p>

    <p>
      1) Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread seeds out on a baking sheet and
      toast in oven for 5–10 minutes, stirring once or twice to avoid burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      2) Place oatmeal in large bowl. In a medium saucepan, heat oil, brown
      sugar, and honey over medium heat, until thin—about 5 minutes. Remove from
      heat. Add vanilla and salt. Pour mixture over oatmeal; add sunflower
      seeds, sesame seeds, and almonds and toss to combine.
    </p>
    <p>
      3) Spread evenly on 2 baking sheets and bake 15 minutes, stirring every 5
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serve with yogurt and berries. Makes enough for a family of four for about
      a week. You can cut everything in half if you only want to use one baking
      sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      For variety, use a little less sunflower and/or sesame seeds and add the
      difference in pumpkin seeds, dried cranberries, raisins, dried apples,
      coconut, or whatever else sounds good.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hope you liked making your own granola!
